### Code written by Bowen Jiang
# Goal: Estsimate the effects from the DAG presented in supplementary material, and used to drive the intervention layer of the CHARIOT model
# R script organization:
# 1. Define functions for effect size conversions (OR ↔ RR ↔ HR)
# 2. Estimate the direct effects of Modifiable Risk Factors (MRFs) on CVD, as odds ratios
#    including an internal consistency check for each MRF
# 3. Convert all MRF direct effect estimates to hazard ratios (HRs) for the modifiable risk factor model
# 4. Perform external consistency check for statin effects

### Derivation of the total effects of statins, antihypertensives, and smoking, as hazards ratios, ###
### used for adjusting for changes in treatment during follow-up #####
######################################################################################################

###
### To convert RR to either HR or OR, we will find the inverse solution to the above equation using a numerical search
### To do this, we create a vector of possible HRs or ORs, that we will put into the function, in order to find a matching
### RR to the RR we are trying to convert.
###

### Create a vector of possible HRs
HRs_possible_gt1 <- seq(1,2,0.00001)
HRs_possible_lt1 <- seq(0,1,0.00001)

### Convert these to RRs
RRs_possible_HRs_gt1 <- sapply(HRs_possible_gt1, convert_HR_to_RR_HRgt1, w = 0.00001, u = 0.3)
RRs_possible_HRs_lt1 <- sapply(HRs_possible_lt1, convert_HR_to_RR_HRlt1, w = 0.00001, u = 0.3)

### Create a vector of possible ORs
ORs_possible_gt1 <- seq(1,2,0.00001)
ORs_possible_lt1 <- seq(0,1,0.00001)

### Convert these to RRs
RRs_possible_ORs_gt1 <- sapply(ORs_possible_gt1, convert_HR_to_RR_HRgt1, w = 0.00001, u = 0.3)
RRs_possible_ORs_lt1 <- sapply(ORs_possible_lt1, convert_HR_to_RR_HRlt1, w = 0.00001, u = 0.3)

###
### Antihypertensives
### Want to convert to HR for adjusting for treatment drop in during model fitting
###

### We have RR from literature
RR_ah <- 0.74

### Now find the first value that matches the target
HR_ah <- HRs_possible_lt1[min(which(RRs_possible_HRs_lt1 > RR_ah))]
HR_ah # 0.72285

### Double check these conversions make sense, by converting the HR back to RR
convert_HR_to_RR_HRlt1(HR_ah, w = 0.00001, u = 0.3)
RR_ah

###
### Statins
### Want to convert to HR for adjusting for treatment drop in during model fitting
###

### We have RR from literature
RR_statins <- 0.75

### Now find the first value that matches the target
HR_statins <- HRs_possible_lt1[min(which(RRs_possible_HRs_lt1 > RR_statins))]
HR_statins # 0.73327

### Double check these conversions make sense, by converting the HR back to RR
convert_HR_to_RR_HRlt1(HR_statins, w = 0.00001, u = 0.3)
RR_statins

###
### Smoking
###

### We have the following effects from literature
OR_smok_init_total <- 1.44
OR_smok_cess_total <- 1/1.25

### Want to convert OR to HR

### Need to first convert OR to RR
RR_smok_init_total <- convert_OR_to_RR_ORgt1(OR = OR_smok_init_total, w = 0.00001, u = 0.3)
RR_smok_init_total

RR_smok_cess_total <- convert_OR_to_RR_ORlt1(OR = OR_smok_cess_total, w = 0.00001, u = 0.3)
RR_smok_cess_total

### Then convert RR to HR

### Now find the first value that matches the target
HR_smok_init_total <- HRs_possible_gt1[min(which(RRs_possible_HRs_gt1 > RR_smok_init_total))]
HR_smok_cess_total <- HRs_possible_lt1[min(which(RRs_possible_HRs_lt1 > RR_smok_cess_total))]
HR_smok_init_total # 1.4064
HR_smok_cess_total # 0.81217

### Double check these conversions make sense, by converting the HR back to RR
convert_HR_to_RR_HRgt1(HR_smok_init_total, w = 0.00001, u = 0.3)
RR_smok_init_total
convert_HR_to_RR_HRlt1(HR_smok_cess_total, w = 0.00001, u = 0.3)
